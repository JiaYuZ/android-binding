= Basic Markup =

Markup is done in standard Android Layout xml file. While keeping original tags untouched, additional markup tags is used to indicate what the view is going bind. For example:

{{{
<TextView android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    binding:text="FirstName"
/>
}}}

Where "binding" is the recommended (but not restricted) namespace alias used for binding View widgets with Model. In the above example, _FirstName_ is an Observable Field that is available in the provided Model.

#summary (View) Model Validation Support in Android Binding

= Introduction =

Android Binding also supports for Model Validation through @Annotation syntax. You may also add custom validation rules in a few easy steps. 

= Initial View Model = 

Let's start with a simple Registration view model:

{{{
public class RegistrationViewModel{
    public final Observable<CharSequence> Login;
    public final Observable<CharSequence> Password;
    public final Observable<CharSequence> ConfirmPassword;
}
}}}

Remember, in Android Binding, it is expected the Observables are _public_ fields, it might be a good practice to decorate it as _final_ so no latter remapping will occur. 

= Add validation rules = 

OK, the login and password are obviously mandatory. It is called *required* in Android Binding. All the validation classes in sitting in the package: com.gueei.android.binding.validation.validators; Remember, if you found the validators are not enough, you can always make a custom one, which will cover later in the post.

So, here's how we instruct the Android Binding that those fields are required:

{{{
public class RegistrationViewModel{
    @required
    public final Observable<CharSequence> Login;
    @required
    public final Observable<CharSequence> Password;
    @required
    public final Observable<CharSequence> ConfirmPassword;
}
}}}

That's it! We just need to put an *@required* annotation attribute to the required field.

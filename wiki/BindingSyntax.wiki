#summary Syntax of Binding in XML file

= Introduction =

Currently, all binding is defined in XML namespace: `http://www.gueei.com/android-binding/`, so, a typical way is include this namespace in each layout file, alongside with the android one:

{{{
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://...."
  xmlns:binding="http://www.gueei.com/android-binding/"
..>
}}}

Binding is by default, to the *public observable* fields of the supplied ViewModel. For example:

{{{
    <TextView binding:text="FirstName" ...
}}}

Means the text of that TextView is binded to an Observable named `FirstName`. Note that the naming is *Case Sensitive*. 

= Binding Types =

|| Type || Meaning ||
|| One-way || Change on value will be reflected in User Interface, but not returned to Model ||
|| Two-way || Same as One-way, but changes in UI also reflected in Model ||
|| One-shot || Only one-time value-assignment from model to UI, UI will not acknowledged to further changes ||

Not all attribute of Views will support all binding modes. For example, the `clickedItem` of AdapterViews is a read-only attribute, that the assignment of value to clickedItem will be ignored by the UI. 

= Special Syntax =

|| Syntax || Example || Effect || type || Supported ||
|| . || binding:text="." || binding to Model itself || one-shot || planned in 0.15 ||
|| _Converter_(_Observable_, ...) || binding:visibility="NOT(EditMode)", binding:width="ADD(A, B)" || Perform the Converter Operation || One-way/two-way (depending on Converter) || planned ||

#summary Syntax of Binding in XML file

= Introduction =

Currently, all binding is defined in XML namespace: `http://www.gueei.com/android-binding/`, so, a typical way is include this namespace in each layout file, alongside with the android one:

{{{
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://...."
  xmlns:binding="http://www.gueei.com/android-binding/"
..>
}}}

Binding is by default, to the *public observable* fields of the supplied ViewModel. For example:

{{{
    <TextView binding:text="FirstName" ...
}}}

Means the text of that TextView is binded to an Observable named `FirstName`. Note that the naming is *Case Sensitive*.

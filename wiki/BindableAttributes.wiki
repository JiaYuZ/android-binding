|| selectedId || long (readonly) || yes ||
|| itemSource || Array, Cursor* || experimental ||
|| itemTemplate || Layout Resource Id || yes ||
|| adapter || Adapter (obsolete the itemSource/Template) || yes ||

* Remark
For array type of Item Source, two way binding is supported. Current restriction: Array must consists of exactly same type of objects, the object can consists of Observable / Command fields, like what you define in models. 

For Cursor type, only one way is supported; You need to supply a defined CursorRowModel to pass to the Binder. (TODO: Document needed) 
In such case, selectedItem / itemSource will return a copy of the CursorRowModel filled with the data from cursor. If the data is modified, a manual calling to refresh the cursor is required. 

== ListView ==
|| Attribute || Accepted Data type || Currently Supported ||
|| onItemClicked || Command || yes ||
|| clickedItem || Object (readonly) || yes ||
|| clickedId || long (readonly) || yes ||

== CompoundButton == 
|| Attribute || Accepted Data type || Currently Supported ||
|| onCheckedChange || Command || yes ||
|| checked || boolean || yes ||

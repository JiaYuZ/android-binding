= activity =

{{{
<activity>
    <actionBar />
    <optionsMenu />
    <rootView />
</activity>
}}}

= actionBar =

Representing the Action Bar. Possibly can be replaced by custom actionbar widget for 3.0- devices.

{{{
    <actionBar
        dataSource="Object"
        display="Boolean"
        onHomeClicked="Command"
        displayHomeAsUpEnabled="Boolean"
    >
        <tabs>
        </tabs>
    </actionBar>
}}}

= optionsMenu =

{{{
    <optionsMenu
        dataSource="Object"
        menuId="Integer"
    />
}}}

= rootView =

{{{
    <rootView
        dataSource="Object"
        layoutId="Integer"
    />
}}}

*NOTE*
If `dataSource` is omitted, it is assume it is the same as the root View Model passed to it. (i.e. `dataSource="."`)
Due to the design of Activity, layout Id is static and cannot be changed. 

= Event = 

Binding Activity should broadcast activity events through EventAggregator, including: 
onPause, onDestroy etc. 

Other activity events should also be bindable, for example: onBackKeyPressed, onKeyPressed etc.
